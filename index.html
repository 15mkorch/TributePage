<h2 id="tribute-info"> History of the Camino</h2>
<p> The history of the Camino is long. “El Camino” translates to “the way”. The Western edge of Spain was once known to be the end of the world years and years ago. It attracted many people for this reason and the superstitions that came along with it. After the body of Saint James was found in a field, the body was brought to Santiago as a relic to the cathedral being built in 1078. A web of paths were created across Spain and France leading to the Cathedral in Santiago. Years ago, pilgrims would walk with only a gourd of water and some cash, relying on the generosity of those along the way. Templars would protect the vulnerable and hospitals were created along the way. Today, over a quarter million pilgrims take on the journey. They come to experience the simplicity, they come to search for something, they come to find themselves. To complete the full Camino (or one complete path), it takes an average of 40 days while walking 11-25 miles a day. </p>
<h2>Personal Stories from the trail </h2>
<p class="stories">My friend Sophie and I were celebrating the end of our 21 mile day with drinks, chocolate, and conversation about culture abroad. In the middle of our conversation, a young man, about our age, walks up to us and asks if we were part of the large group of Americans. Just as I confirm his suspicion, he pops another question out in a German accent. I briefly explain that we are part of an entrepreneurship and faith school and kicking off our year with the Camino. His eyes are hungry and you can almost see the gears turning in his mind, perhaps faster than he can comprehend. “What does faith mean to you?” he asks. I was stunned by the magnitude of this question and invited him to sit down and join us. We then talked deeply about who God is and how we understand truth. I don't know if he would accept Jesus after that conversation, but do know that I was blessed by it, and pray that he was too.<p>
  <p class="stories" >One evening, we held a worship session in the town square outside our hostel. We opened our hearts to the Spirit and what God had wanted to teach us during that time. That evening, a number of pilgrims from all over had came to worship with us or listen to our prayer and music. One of my teammates even prayed with a man for healing on his leg. The middle aged woman who sat next to me cried because she had felt lonely on the journey and needed God. I can't attest to how the other pilgrims felt the spirit that night, but I can say they were in its presence. I can also say that our squad was refreshed by God and the peace he brought us through musical worship.<p>
